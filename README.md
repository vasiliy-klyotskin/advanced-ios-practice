## Introduction

Welcome to the Pokemon Feed iOS Application repository! This application allows users to browse through a feed of Pokemon and discover information about them. The project is designed to showcase various software development concepts and principles, including Test-Driven Development (TDD), Modular Design, Composition Root Pattern, Dependency Rejection, SOLID Principles, Packaging Principles, Command-Query Separation (CQS), Snapshot Tests, and End-to-End (E2E) Tests.

The Pokemon Feed iOS Application is a mobile app designed to provide users with an engaging experience of exploring the world of Pokemon. It fetches a feed of Pokemon data, allowing users to view detailed information about each Pokemon, enhancing their knowledge and connection with the Pokemon universe.
